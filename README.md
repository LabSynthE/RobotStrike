<p>All the media you need to stage your own <em>Robot Strike!</em> with Starship food delivery agents is here.</p>

<p>On December 2, 2021 <b>LabSynthE</b> organized a <em>Robot Strike!</em> with fourteen Tobors (that's r-o-b-o-t backwards), UTD's personified delivery vehicles. We sprayed the ground with chalked slogans; then about 22 lab members and students from ATCM 4330 Culture Jamming (Fall 2021) ordered from Starship in staggered times. We figured out a way to keep the well organized fleet in strike position.* And, just for fun, we had all of them play “All I Want for Christmas is You” (Mariah Carey version), so there was a bit of noise, and subsequent laughing and dancing. Watch the video to learn why we staged a strike. It was the most perfect ending to my culture jamming class ever and a highly successful first launch of the Robot Strike! project, developed in LabSynthE with Murilo Paiva-Homsi and David Adelman.</p>

<p>*To keep the Starship fleet in strike position:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download the Starship app and order an item; </li>
  <li>When the robot arrives, leave it closed for about five minutes as part of the performance; </li>
   <li>Opene the agent and take your food items but DO NOT CLOSE the robot; </li>
     <li>Instead of closing the robot, close the Starship app on your mobile device; </li>
       <li>Reopen the app—the robot thinks you are opening it for the first time so the song (if you selected a song) plays again...</li>
         <li>Continue this pattern of closing the app and reopening the robot for as long as you want the robot to sit in its strike position</li>
  </ol>
