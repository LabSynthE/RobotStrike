# RobotStrike
<p>All the media you need to stage your own <em>Robot Strike!</em> with Starship food delivery agents is here.</p>

<p>On December 2, 2021 <b>LabSynthE</b> organized a <em>Robot Strike!</em> with fourteen Tobors (that's r-o-b-o-t backwards), UTD's personified delivery vehicles. We sprayed the ground with chalked slogans; then about 22 lab members and students from ATCM 4330 Culture Jamming (Fall 2021) ordered from Starship in staggered times. We figured out a way to keep the well organized fleet in strike position.* And, just for fun, we had all of them play “All I Want for Christmas is You” (Mariah Carey version), so there was a bit of noise, and subsequent laughing and dancing. Watch the video to learn why we staged a strike. It was the most perfect ending to my culture jamming class ever and a highly successful first launch of the Robot Strike! project, developed in LabSynthE with Murilo Paiva-Homsi and David Adelman.</p>

<p>We documented our initial strike <a href = "https://vimeo.com/xtineburrough/robotstrike" alt="Robot Strike! on Vimeo">in this video.</a></p>

<p>Use this repository for stencil templates (modify and/or contribute new ones here) and notes about strikes you create on your campus.</p>

<p>*To keep the Starship fleet in strike position:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download the Starship app and order an item; </li>
  <li>When the robot arrives, leave it closed for about five minutes as part of the performance; </li>
   <li>Opene the agent and take your food items but DO NOT CLOSE the robot; </li>
     <li>Instead of closing the robot, close the Starship app on your mobile device; </li>
       <li>Reopen the app—the robot thinks you are opening it for the first time so the song (if you selected a song) plays again...</li>
         <li>Continue this pattern of closing the app and reopening the robot for as long as you want the robot to sit in its strike position</li>
  </ol>
  
 <h1>Stencils</h1>
 <p>The file <b>stencils.zip</b> includes the Illustrator native (.ai) files and the exported .DXF files that xtine used to cut the strike slogan phrases from cheap poster board from the Dollar Store.</p>
 
 <p>x used the typeface Roboto, of course! It's a <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto" alt="roboto">google font.</a></p>
 
 <p>We would have used our laser cutter but it was broken at the time, so instead x used an old <a href="https://www.silhouettecameo.com/" alt="Silhouette main page">Silhouette Cameo</a> (the Cricket from around 2017). It worked well, the letters were easily removed from the posterboard. If you are using one of these, import the DXF files to the Silhouette Studio app then send it off to cut. Our settings were blade: 2, depth: 8, speed 5. Your settings may differ depending on your machine and the paper you use.</p>
  
  <p>We used sidewalk spray chalk for kids that we picked up at Target.</p>
